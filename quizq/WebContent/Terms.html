      <h2>Terms & Conditions</h2>
     
      <br><br>
      <p>1 - Terms used in this agreement</p>
<p>For the purposes of this contract the term "Registrant" should be taken to mean any person or business making use of the registration system 
provided on this site. The term "IP Rights Office" refers to the Intellectual Property Rights Office (see "Parties to this Agreement", below). 
'The term "Work" refers to the file or files submitted for registration or intended for submission to registration. </p>
<p>2 - Registering Works </p>
<p>By completing the registration process the Registrant grants the IP Rights Office and its authorized archive partners the unrestricted right
 to record and copy their Work for archiving purposes only. Any copies made will be treated as confidential and will not be made
 public or knowingly made available to any persons or organizations other than authorized archivists and, if required by law, law enforcement agencies. </p>
 <p>By submitting a file for registration the Registrant asserts that they are the rightful owner of the Work, or are acting on behalf of the rightful owner,
 and that the details of the rightful owner have been given as those to whom the work is registered, and are correct and accurate to the best of the
 Registrant's knowledge. The Registrant warrants that all items submitted are suitable for registration, and is aware that the IP Rights Office
 does not make any judgement regarding the suitability of submitted material. </p>
 <p>The Registrant shall, if requested by the IP Rights Office, supply it with any declaration necessary for the purposes of obtaining any consent or 
 clearance which the IP Rights Office might be required to obtain by any competent authority to enable it to perform the service being requested by 
 the Registrant, in a form specified by the IP Rights Office. </p>
 <p>In order for a Work to be registered the Registrant must make appropriate payment via the WorldPay payment facility only. Payment cannot be accepted 
 by any other means. Works to be registered must be submitted via the upload facility provided, or (failing that) by email (upon invitation only). 
 No Works will be accepted in hard copy format or by email prior to payment. If the Registrant fails to upload the Work using the upload facility and also 
 fails to provide the Work by email within 28 days of the payment of the registration fee then the information provided relating to the Work and/or 
 the registration fee will be archived alone as evidence of the date of claim to copyright ownership. Without the actual Work archived, however, the
 efficaciousness of the registration will be seriously compromised, for which the IP Rights Office can accept no liability. </p>
 <p>Payment made for registration covers the uploading and archiving of the Work and/or the details of the Work and associated registration fee payment only.
 Storage of said Work and/or details is provided free of charge and as such any early termination of registration does not affect the cost of the registration
 and does not constitute grounds for refund, either in whole or in part. </p>
 <p>3 - Privacy </p>
 <p>By Registering a Work the Registrant gives permission for certain minimum details to be made publicly available via the Copyright Registration Website. 
 These include: the legal name of the business or person to which the Work is registered; the country of residence of the person or business to which the 
 Work is registered; the title of the Work (as at the point of registration); the category into which the registration falls; the dates of registration and 
 expiry; the registration number; and the status of the registration.</p>
 <p>The Registrant has the right and ability to control whether or not other details such as contact details are made publicly available and can alter these
 preferences both before and after registration. The IP Rights Office accepts no liability for any error made by Registrants in the setting of their
 preferences. </p>
 <p>4 - Liability and Refunds Policy.</p>
 <p>No refund can be made on any payment once the service relating to that payment has been begun (in the case of 
 registrations, once a file has been uploaded in whole or in part to our server, or its details entered in the database, etc.; in the case of retrievals,
 once the document(s) have been retrieved from the archive), unless there has been a failure on the part of the IP Rights Office to fulfil or abide by
 the terms and conditions laid out in this agreement. Once a Work has been uploaded and archived the service in relation to the payment made for registration
 is complete. In any case, no refund can be made more than 28 days after payment.</p>
